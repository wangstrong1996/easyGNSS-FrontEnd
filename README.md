# Easy-GNSS-Frontend
This repository is a part of my easy GNSS project. It provides a GNSS front end for realizing various types of GNSS positioning algorithms.

## Easy-GNSS Structure
1. Easy-GNSS Pre-Frontend: GNSS data downloader
2. Easy-GNSS Frontend: GNSS raw data decoder, GNSS error models, GNSS cycle slip detection, ...
3. Easy-GNSS Backend: GNSS positioning algorithm, including SPP, PPP, PPP-AR, PPP-RTK, RTK, based on Kalman Filter or Batch Least Squares

## How to use Easy-GNSS Frontend 
1. Download easyGNSS_frontend.exe and easyGNSS_frontend.cfg here
